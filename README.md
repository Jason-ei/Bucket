Simple Digit Recognition OCR in OpenCV Python
=============================================

This code is originally based on Abid Rahman K's answer in [Simple Digit Recognition OCR in OpenCV-Python](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9413216/simple-digit-recognition-ocr-in-opencv-python/9620295).

Several tiny modification has been made to adapt OpenCV's new API.

Hope it helps for OpenCV newbies.


### Progress
Run `train.py`, label the number surrounded with red rectangle **manually**. The labeled result will seems like 

![Train Result](/data/train_result.png)

Run `test.py`, the program will load the test image and automatically recognize digits using `KNearNeighbour` Algorithm. The results will seem like

Labeled Test Image
